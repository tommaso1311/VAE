# VAE - Creation Of A Variational Auto Encoder For Image Compression And Generation

This is the final exam project I wrote for the course in Image Analysis for Applied Physics. It consists in the creation of a Variational Auto Encoder which compress images in a features vector thanks to a convolutional neural network (encoder). The image can then be reconstructed thanks to another neural network (decoder). Both parts are trained together, so the VAE is an "adversarial model".
