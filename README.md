# VAE - Creation Of A Variational Auto Encoder For Image Compression And Generation

This is the final exam project I wrote for the course in Image Analysis for Applied Physics. It consists in the creation of a Variational Auto Encoder which compress images in a features vector thanks to a convolutional neural network (encoder).
The image can then be reconstructed thanks to another neural network (decoder).

## The Project

The project is written in Python and TensorFlow and is divided into 5 main files:

* header.py: it contains all the imports and definitions of some parameters, the dataset class and encoder and decoder functions;

* project.py: it contains the loss function, the optimizer and the code used to train the neural networks;

* loader.py & loader2.py: are used to load pre-trained neural networks to generate original images into "generated/" and "comparison/".

* visualize.ipynb: it allows to manually modify the latent vector provided to the decoder in order to visualize the effects of different features on final images.

### The Convolutional Neural Network

The first convolutional neural network has 4 convolutional layers with different filters sizes. It creates two encoded vectors that will be used by the decoding network to recreate the image.

The second convolutional neural network has just one input (the sampled latent vector) and is perfectly symmetric to the encoder network. It simply returns the reconstructed image.

## Training And Results

The convolutional neural networks are then trained over the entire MNIST dataset **(not contained in MNIST_all/ for size reason)** and the model is saved for later **(not contained in model/)**.
A selection of the final best images, created from random latent vector, is visible in the image below:
